	<h2>Why RentalGeek.com</h2>
		<p class="justifytext"><em>R</em>enting is big business and it's getting even bigger. With today's technology, you have plenty to track and no time for inefficiency. You already know property listing sites like Zillow, Trulia, Hotpad and others. They vary in size and goals, but they all have one thing in common: <strong>relevant</strong> <a href="#">online visibility in the property vental market</a>. they've gotten there by using berakthrough technologies and creating business arrangements, increasing the visibility of their clients significantly in the process. However, some of these sites often rely on 3rd party service providers like Appfolio or Property Genie; software that can push listings to their existing online databases. The problem is the final push process is often done without the knowledge of the property manager/owner and the listing may not be updated when units are leased. causing user frustration. </p>
